How to add new glyphs to existing scripts?

   Usually one wants to add accented glyphs. In that case fontforge
   script commands (for example, AddAccent, BuildComposite) may be used.
   Fontforge can produce more or less satisfactory character. It may be
   adjusted by fontforge preferences. For such simple batch editions it
   has not to build everything from scratch. You can create simple
   fontforge script, for example:
   
#!/usr/local/bin/fontforge
fontname=$1
Open(fontname+".sfd")
SetPref("AccentOffsetPercent",5)
SetPref("AccentCenterLowest",0)
SetPref("CharCenterHighest",0)
Select("imacron")
BuildAccented()
Save(fontname+"-my.sfd")                                                               
Close()
Quit()

   You may insert here if commands for specific fonts:

if (font_var == "bl")
 SetPref("CharCenterHighest",1)
else
 ...

   Look at mergefonts.pe for more examples.
   Then run it with name of some sfd font file from
   cm-unicode-*-sfd.tar.bz2 without sfd extension, e. g.

$fontforge -script aaa.ff `basename cmunrm.sfd .sfd`

   Then send me required commands from  this script, I shall include them
   into mergefonts.pe

   If you are dissatisfied by the quality of glyph created by the
   fontforge or you created totally new glyph:
   
   Create new font with glyphs will be added to cm-unicode and their
   dependencies, when these glyphs contain references.
   
   Save this font with additions with filename containing some prefix
   and cm-unicode suffix (basename of sfd file from
   cm-unicode-*-sfd.tar.bz2 without initial "cmun"), e. g.: aaarm.sfd
   
   And send me these sfd files.

How to print using opentype fonts from KDE 3.5?

   At first install the fonts for ghostscript.
   As a workaround for printing with Qt 3.3 call Fontmap.CMU.alias after
   Fontmap.CMU in ghostscript's Fontmap file. It would substitute some
   fonts.
