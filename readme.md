You like Beamer but need to use PowerPoint? Fake Beamer is for you!

(don't worry, those icons in the bottom left are only visable on the presenter's screen)

## Disclaimer

I don't fully appreciate (read: understand) Microsoft PowerPoint.
This template and theme have undergone only mild testing via my Mac (Monterrey) and a Windows 11 VM.
I suspect there to be some bugs, particularly associated with the required fonts.

## How to use

### Install theme or template

You can properly install this as what Microsoft calls a "Theme" using the `fake-beamer.thmx` file.
The `fake-beamer.potx` file is the "Template" file.
I do not grok the difference between these, but both should work.
You should also be able to just use the example presentation, `example.pptx`.

### Install Computer Modern fonts

What would a Fake Beamer be without appropriate _Computer Modern_ fonts?!
They are so important, I even included them in the repository. 
You should install them.
Learn to do this [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749) (Mac) or [here](https://www.lifewire.com/install-fonts-in-windows-11-5192443) (Windows).

### Enable Header \& Footer

The classic Beamer footer can only be seen by enabling "Headers \& Footers"!
Do this via `Insert`, `Header \& Footer` and then fill out as appropriate. 

### I don't like the classic Beamer Blue!

I don't really like it either, but it's the Beamer hallmark. 
In either case, you can change that bright blue to something else by selecting all your slides, then (on Mac) `Format`, `Theme Colors`. 
Then you can change `Accent 1` to your favorite color.
You can also change the font colors. 
The other named colors are not used by the theme.

Git isn't built for such PowerPoint files, but I appreciate comments via Issues.
I also will accept fixes via Pull Requests, if you can explain them well.
